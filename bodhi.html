              <p>Plate reader applications are typically used in clinical and laboratory settings,
                in which a technician needs to run a protocol or assay. Their workflow involves
                pipetting samples and reagents into well plate(s) (also known as micro-plates),
                setting up the hardware and software, and running the experiment.
              </p>
              <p>
                The current market for plate reader applications is fragmented, with hundreds of inflexible
                products each designed for specific use cases. This means labs must purchase multiple products
                to accommodate various assays, leading to inefficiencies and added costs. Technicians also face
                challenges such as poor usability, outdated and inconsistent interfaces, and information overload,
                which are common problems across scientific software.

              <h6>Prior Research</h6>
              <p>The user research team provided us with a workflow analysis, mapping out the
                steps of a typical user setting up and running an experiment using a well plate.
                For the purpose of quickly reaching an MVP, we focused only on the simplest
                workflow, in which the user is selecting a pre-defined protocol. There are five
                main sections in the flow: sign in, select protocol, run protocol, view results,
                and export results. The product manager also provided us with a set of proto-personas
                to get started.</p>

              <div class="row-in-column fade-in">
                <h6>Competitive Analysis</h6>
                <p>Before diving into design, I worked with my co-designer on a competitive analysis
                  to better understand the market. We looked at four existing products in the problem space
                  and pulled out key insights from each one, highlighting what was unique
                  along with the common themes across products. We also roughly mapped the workflow for each
                  application to see which patterns are most common, as this may influence user expectations.

                  <p>
                    Using the workflow analysis, proto-personas, and competitive analysis, we got started with the design process. When working in Figma, I used our design system patterns and components to achieve consistency with the rest of our brand.

                  <h6>Iterative Design</h6>
                  <p>
                      We followed a 'fail fast, learn fast' philosophy with this project, creating a lot of iterations in close collaboration with the team: a product manager, developer, and our design/research advisors. While the actual process was a lot messier than what's shown below, it can be summarized into five iterations or stages, starting with sketches and ending with final designs. After each step, we made sure to align with the team and decide on our priorities for the next stage. As with any design process, we added more details in each round as we ironed out the requirements and integrated feedback.

                  <h6>Brainstorming & Sketching</h6>
                  <p>
                    I find it helpful to formulate my thoughts and ideas on paper first, so I started with a few (messy) sketches.
                    Looking at references from our design system, the company's other products, and competitors, I began to plan out
                    what the screens may look like. I used a compilation of
                    products (from within and outside of the company) to inform my design options at this stage, along with the workflow
                    map to see how the steps are typically divided.

                    <h4>
                      The main challenge during this phase was designing the navigation, as it had to incorporate functionality from three different
                      applications. We carefully planned the information architecture to ensure all features fit seamlessly into
                      a single navigation bar.
                    </h4>
                  </div>
                  <p>
                    I discussed the sketches with my co-designer and compared our ideas. We then moved into Figma and began rough layouts
                    and wireframes, slowly building up the level of detail and making sure to leave notes on any questions or assumptions
                    for future reference.

              <div class="row-in-column fade-in">
                <h6>Decision Making Process: Layout</h6>
                <p>
                    After the third round of iterating, we had multiple options for aspects concerning the layout and structure.
                    The main point of discussion was the location of the primary call-to-action (CTA) button on each page. We deliberated
                    over the best location to put this element. There were three options that could've worked, and it seemed to depend
                    on the type of content being shown, which varied greatly.
                </p>
                <img class="case-study-inline-pics" src="/Images/Bodhi-Layout-Iteration.png" alt="three layout options for button placement">
                <p>
                    We decided on Layout 1 in the end, going back to UX principles and common patterns. Since the CTA is directly
                    related to each page title and it represents moving to the next step, we decided to place it in the top right corner,
                    vertically aligned with the title and above the main content. This choice maximizes vertical space while ensuring the
                    action is always visible, even if the user scrolls or hides the sidebar.

              <div class="row-in-column fade-in">
                <h6>Final Designs</h6>
                <p>
                  We ran two more rounds of iteration and continued to add features, comprising a final set of 10 screens that illustrated
                  the most critical aspects of the workflow. In this MVP, users can view
                  and select their protocols from a card or table view. They can access a sidebar for making quick edits to the
                  protocol/plate, or access more advanced settings to modify it further. They can also upload protocols from a file
                  or create new ones. After selecting a protocol, they can confirm/edit the plate map, and are guided by the software
                  at this stage to set up for the experiment. Once setup is complete, the experiment will run and display live updates
                  on the screen. Finally, the user can access a variety of export settings to suit their needs.

                This design project was very fast-paced, including three design reviews that took place only a few days apart,
                due to the tight timeline. I was surprised and proud to see how much we could accomplish in this timeframe, and
                helped me understand the value of sprints like this and the agile environment in which this took place.

                  Most existing applications in this field have crowded interfaces which can be overwhelming.
                  Through progressive disclosure techniques, we can show the user exactly what
                  they need for the task they’re performing, while keeping other information off

                When working with complex and scientific applications, it's crucial to consult industry experts and/or proxy users
                throughout the process. They can help you block out the noise (regarding technical jargon, understanding the science
                behind the process, etc.) and understand what users value.

                Further rounds of iteration will be required to bring the project to an MVP
                stage, as we only had a few weeks to work on the project. However, the team
                learned a lot throughout this short sprint, and it was very impactful for me
                to work on the end-to-end design of a complex application like this one.
