                    <p>The purpose of this project is to improve the experience of plate reader applications
                      used in life sciences and diagnostics. Current products on the market are known to have
                      poor usability with outdated and inconsistent interfaces, along with constant information
                      overload. The goal is to create a flexible and scalable product that can work for any plate
                      reader protocol. Through quick rounds of iteration we worked to design an MVP, guided by
                      research insights from myself and other team members. I completed a persona study for this
                      project, along with designs ranging from sketches to high-fidelity screens.</p>

            <div class="ten-twelfth-column">
              <p>Plate reader applications are typically used in clinical and laboratory settings,
                in which a technician needs to run a protocol or assay. Their workflow involves
                pipetting samples and reagents into well plate(s) (also known as micro-plates),
                setting up the hardware and software, and running the experiment. Current products
                on the market are known to have poor usability, outdated & inconsistent interfaces,
                and information overload.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is a massive variety of assays that need to be accounted for when designing a
                general use plate reader. Currently, this range of use cases is covered by hundreds
                of existing products made by hundreds of companies. Since each product is built for
                a specific situation, they are relatively inflexible and the customer has to buy
                additional products if theyâ€™d like to expand their workflow.

                <h5>The goal: Create a functional, flexible, usable, and delightful product
                  that can essentially replace the majority of existing plate readers and fill this

              <h6>Prior Research</h6>
              <p>The user research team provided us with a workflow analysis, mapping out the
                steps of a typical user setting up and running an experiment using a well plate.
                For the purpose of quickly reaching an MVP, we focused only on the simplest
                workflow, in which the user is selecting a pre-defined protocol. There are five
                main sections in the flow: sign in, select protocol, run protocol, view results,
                and export results. The product manager also provided us with a set of proto-personas
                to get started.</p>

                <h6>Competitive Analysis</h6>
                <p>Before diving into design, I worked with my co-designer on a competitive analysis
                  to better understand the market. We looked at four existing products in the problem space
                  and pulled out key insights from each one, highlighting what was unique
                  along with the common themes across products. We also roughly mapped the workflow for each
                  application to see which patterns are most common, as this may influence user expectations.

                <p>After completing the design work for this project, I carried out two research projects
                  as part of my course - one focused on persona development, while the latter focused on user
                  research methods. The first project included setting user experience and usability goals,
                  creating two proto-personas, conducting a UR safari to validate assumptions, and creating two
                  detailed (evidence-based) personas with briefs. The second project included a user experience
                  analysis based on a specific user research question, followed by a formative usability study.
                  A case study will be coming soon for this project - feel free to reach out and ask questions
                  in the meantime!

                  <p>
                    Using the workflow analysis, proto-personas, and competitive analysis, we got started with
                    the design process. When working in Figma, I used our design system patterns and components
                    to achieve consistency with the rest of our brand. Check out <a href="https://revvity.design/22ce34993/p/4243bd-unifyux" style="color: #404040" target="blank">revvity.design</a>

              <div class="row-in-column">
                  <h6>Brainstorming & Sketching</h6>
                  <p>I find it helpful to formulate my thoughts and ideas on paper first, so I started with a few (messy) sketches.
                    Looking at references from our design system, the company's other products, and competitors, I began to plan out
                    what the screens may look like. The most difficult part to plan was the navigation and overall structure, as this
                    affected everything within it and determined the overall workflow. Since the project scope is so broad, it was
                    challenging to narrow all the possibilities down into one navigation bar with clear steps. I used a compilation of
                    products (from within and outside of the company) to inform my design options at this stage, along with the workflow
                    map to see how the steps are typically divided.
                  </p>
                  <img class="case-study-inline-pics" src="/Images/Bodhi sketches.png" alt="hand-drawn sketches">
                  <p>I discussed the sketches with my co-designer and compared our ideas. We then moved into Figma and began rough layouts
                    and wireframes, slowly building up the level of detail and making sure to leave notes on any questions or assumptions
                    for future reference.
                  </p>
              </div>

              <div class="row-in-column">
                  <h6>Decision Making Process</h6>
                  <p>After the first round of iterating, we had multiple options for aspects concerning the layout and structure.
                    One example was the layout for the primary call-to-action or next step indicator on each page. We deliberated
                    over the best location to put this action, because depending on what screen was being shown, there were
                    multiple options that could've worked, and there was not one easy answer that worked best for every screen.
                    However, we decided on Layout 1 in the end, since having the CTA in the top right is a common pattern and it
                    maximized vertical space while ensuring the action was always visible, even if the user hid the sidebar.

              </div>

              <div class="row-in-column">
                <h6>Final Designs</h6>
                <p>We iterated in each round and continued to add more features, eventually ending up
                  with 10 final screens that illustrated the most critical aspects of the workflow. In this MVP, users can view
                  and select their protocols from a card or table view. They can access a sidebar for making quick edits to the
                  protocol/plate, or access more advanced settings to modify it further. They can also upload protocols from a file
                  or create new ones. After selecting a protocol, they can confirm/edit the plate map, and are guided by the software
                  at this stage to set up for the experiment. Once setup is complete, the experiment will run and display live updates
                  on the screen. Finally, the user can access a variety of export settings to suit their needs.

                This design project was very fast-paced, including three design reviews that took place only a few days apart,
                due to the tight timeline. I was surprised and proud to see how much we could accomplish in this timeframe, and
                helped me understand the value of sprints like this and the agile environment in which this took place.

                Most existing applications in this field have crowded interfaces which can be overwhelming.
                Through progressive disclosure techniques, we can show the user exactly what
                they need for the task theyâ€™re performing, while keeping other information off
                the screen until they need it.
              </p>
              <p>
                When working with complex and scientific applications, it's crucial to consult industry experts and/or proxy users
                throughout the process. They can help you block out the noise (regarding techincal jargon, understanding the science
                behind the process, etc.) and understand what users value.

                We took all the functionality from multiple products to build a powerful,
                flexible, and scalable product with clear workflows and refreshed UI.
                Further rounds of iteration will be required to bring the project to an MVP
                stage, as we only had a few weeks to work on the project. However, the team
                learned a lot throughout this short sprint, and it was very impactful for me
                to work on the end-to-end experience of a complex application like this one.
