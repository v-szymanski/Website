                      Flourish is a mobile application that aims to empower people through education,
                      knowledge and advocacy for period poverty. To encourage everyday use, it is also

                      millions of menstruating people. Our design process in a nutshell: find a topic
                      we care about, define the problem, empathize with our users, analyze competitors,
                      map out the application structure, and iterate many, many times.

                This app was created as part of the Adobe x MTV College Creative Jam, centered around encouraging advocacy.
                My teammate and I wanted to break the stigma around the menstrual cycle and create a tight-knit community for
                those on their periods to relate to each other, share stories, and find comfort. This led us to the idea of
                encouraging the everyday user to advocate for a cause, through platforms that they already use.
              </p>

              <p>
                During the Adobe x MTV Creative Jam opening ceremony, they revealed the challenge: design a mobile app that
                encourages individuals to advocate for a cause through the use of pop culture & media. We were able to choose
                any cause we liked, so we began discussing different causes and researching the ones we felt strongly about.
              </p>
              <p>
                Given the initial prompt, “How can we encourage advocacy through pop culture or media?” and our brainstorming
                session, we came up with a more specific problem statement to fit our app.
              </p>
              <div class="callout callout-pink">
                <h4>
                  “How can we encourage casual users to advocate for period poverty while providing valuable functionality
                  through a mobile application?”
                </h4>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="five-twelfth-column">
              <p>
                We began with a simple concept mapping activity on Adobe XD and aimed to write down any cause that came to our
                minds, no matter how random or unfeasible it seemed to us.

              <h6>User Personas</h6>
              <p>
                In order to empathize with our target user groups, we created user personas about a variety of people who may
                use our app, varying in age from pre-teens to adults.

                <h6>Competitive Analysis</h6>
                <p>
                  We looked at other organizations who are working in the same problem space, to gain inspiration and see what
                  improvements we could make to existing products.

            <div class="five-twelfth-column">
              <h6>Information Architecture</h6>
              <p>
                We discussed features that we thought would be beneficial to users through a quick ‘feature jamming’ meeting.
                Then, we talked through what the user flow would look like, creating an information architecture flowchart in
                the process.

              <h3>Wireframing, Prototyping</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="ten-twelfth-column">
              <p>
                After finalizing our information architecture above, we moved on to low-medium fidelity prototyping of the app’s
                main experiences - onboarding, track, explore, discuss, and advocate. The purpose of this round was to quickly
                communicate our ideas and figure out how the application structure worked in practice. Then, we discussed our
                designs and iterated multiple times.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also created a style guide for our app to establish strong branding. We opted for the name ‘Flourish’,
                which is a wordplay that combines the ‘flow’ of a period with our app’s mission - for our cause to flourish.
                The colour palette consists of reds and pinks to represent the intersection of femininity and strength.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once this was finalized, we were able to create a high-fidelity prototype with interaction design.
              </p>
              <div class="row-in-column fade-in">
                <h6>Onboarding</h6>
                <p>
                  The app opens with a loading screen and some animations. Here, we introduce the app's branding and mission,
                  followed by a simple sign-up process.
                </p>
                <h6>Tour</h6>
                <p>
                  After signing up, the app starts with an optional tour to show users around the app and introduce them to
                  the main screens. This is especially important for showing users all of the community & advocacy features
                  embedded within our app - there's a lot more functionality than just tracking the menstrual cycle!
                </p>
                <h6>Track</h6>
                <p>
                  This is the portion of our app that we expect the majority of our users downloaded the app for. Having a
                  way to track one's menstrual cycle is crucial, so we aimed to provide this feature with an intuitive,
                  aesthetic interface. Users can track a variety of symptoms with specific details about each type; then,
                  this data can be viewed in a daily log.
                </p>
                <h6>Advocate</h6>
                <p>
                  This is probably the most important section of our app - advocating for our cause. We implemented this
                  feature in a way that is easily discoverable but not forceful in its display, as we wanted our users to
                  learn about the cause and help out on their own terms, however they are able to given their personal situations.
                  In fact, that is the bottom line of our app - we aim to encourage advocacy in the everyday person's life.
                </p>
                <h6>Explore</h6>
                <p>
                  Taking inspiration from many popular social media apps, we decided to implement an Explore page to allow users
                  to read up on issues that concern them, regarding any aspect of their lifestyle. We decided to sort the content
                  by categories, so that users can scroll through a curated feed of posts related to the topic of their choice.
                </p>
                <h6>Discuss</h6>
                <p>
                  Finally, we created a Discussion page for users to connect by sharing funny stories, relating over common problems,
                  or finding other people who are going through the same thing as them. Menstruating can be an isolating or even scary
                  experience if you do not have anyone in your life to talk to about it, so we wanted to create a safe space for our users.

            <div class="ten-twelfth-column">
              <h6>Key takeaways</h6>
              <p>
                Firstly, I learned that I always need to think about the type of language I’m using and the implications that
                go with it. Inclusivity in design is so essential; I don’t want to leave out a group of users or give them negative
                feelings from using my product. (More on this in the next section.)
              </p>
              <p>
                I also found the research & ideation for this project to be quite interesting. My teammate and I realized how
                difficult it is to design an app that not only allows users to advocate for a cause, but also fulfills some sort
                of basic need or functionality in our users’ lives.
              </p>
              <div class="callout callout-pink">
                <h4>
                  The mission we took on was to inspire advocacy in an everyday user; it is simpler to design an app that just
                  prompts users to sign petitions, fundraise or spread awareness, but we wanted to go beyond that. We realized
                  it is challenging to motivate people to download an app or advocate for a cause that does not directly affect them.
                </h4>
              </div>
              <p>
                Therefore, it is important to always consider user intentions and motivations to ensure your product will
                reach a greater audience.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, here are some realizations I had regarding the design process:<br>• Setting a schedule for
                each step of the process can be helpful with keeping on track.<br>• Timed activities prevent you from
                getting caught up in the details, which is especially important in a design sprint like this one.
              </p>
              <div class="row-in-column fade-in">
                <h6>What would I change next time?</h6>
                <p>
                  If I were to create this app again, I would address trans and gender non-conforming users by taking
                  away the implication that only women have their periods. Language is important, as I mentioned above,
                  and I seek to include all users, not exclude.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition, conducting more in-depth user research could have been beneficial and allowed us to better
                  understand our user group. Even a quick survey would have helped to challenge our own assumptions and
                  ensure that we were designing for a larger group of people than just ourselves. While our user personas
                  helped us to empathize with our imaginary user group, the best practice would have been to survey and/or
                  interview people first, then create our personas based off the data we received.
