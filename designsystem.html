                      This ongoing project at Revvity aims to create a unified design system for all product design, including software, hardware, and reagents. Starting in 2022 during my internship, I helped evolve it into a scalable company-wide initiative involving the design team, senior leaders, developers, and product managers. I played a key role in launching the project and designed various components, ranging from small 'atoms' like buttons and text fields to larger 'systems' like log-in and system status. Following the company's rebranding to Revvity, I helped define a new branding strategy and developed initial components under the new guidelines. The public documentation is available at <a href="https://revvity.design/22ce34993/p/4243bd-unifyux" style="color: #404040" target="blank">revvity.design</a>.

                  Revvity (previously known as PerkinElmer) is a major producer of biotechnology products. They create software and hardware solutions to serve scientists, researchers, and clinicians in the life sciences and diagnostics industries. I contributed to the creation and, later, the rebranding of the company-wide design system. Follow my journey from January 2022 to December 2023!

                      My work on this project spans 3 co-op terms, as the design system evolved from a lofty aspiration into a highly successful initiative with buy-in and support from teams across the company.

                          <b>January to April 2022:</b> I helped get the project off the ground by compiling tons of previous work from designers before me, revamping a documentation website to ensure our progress was accessible to other teams, and advocating for the system’s growth.

              <h6>The Problem</h6>
              <p>
                In January 2022, product designers across the company were using scattered resources and components to design new products, and they lacked a centralized source of truth. It was often difficult for designers to justify their choices, as they did not have the capacity to conduct research on their own, so many things were left up to the opinion of an entire product team, rather than making evidence-based decisions. As a result, each product had its own style determined by the team that created it, but there was little consistency across PerkinElmer software. Some designers had tried to push for a design system in the past, but it proved to be a time-consuming task for people that already had their plate full with other work.

                <h4>
                  How can we drive consistency across all PerkinElmer products and make research-based design decisions?

              <div class="row-in-column">
                <h6>My Solution</h6>
                <p>
                  I discovered an existing website documenting common UX patterns, created by another designer, and decided to revive and expand it. With little structure to guide me, I created my own process, starting with gathering design artifacts from across UX. I found that the simplest and most consistent component was the button, so I used that as a testing ground for documentation. Using zeroheight.com to host the website, I explored how we could best utilize its features. My first draft included a simple page with tabs for component overview, usage, and existing variants.

                <p>
                  Collaborating with a UX Research co-op, I integrated research recommendations to design components and write evidence-based usage guidelines. During this time, we also met with the majority of the design team to better understand their priorities and needs.

                    After 2 months, we were encouraged by our managers to present this as a proposal to senior leadership, including the VP of Software Platforms. Shortly after, we did just that: introducing our proof-of-concept, highlighting our rapid progress, and explaining the benefits of a design system for product teams across all functions.

                We led numerous presentations to senior stakeholders, which received overwhelmingly positive feedback. These soon turned into quarterly updates, where I was able to share new advancements and advocate for further growth. Each quarter, we brought multiple new product leaders into the project and embedded the design system into an increasing number of development teams.

                  Now that our project had been marketed across the company, we worked to refine processes for building components, edit the documentation website, and follow a schedule of publishing updates to the design team. To grow the design system, we added new components based on demand, using a project management board to create and track tickets. Designers were able to request new additions at any time, and we acted as quickly as possible to help team members who faced deadlines.

                    My approach from the very beginning of this project was to base the design system around our products, not the other way around. If our product designers could justify the need for a new artifact, I would build it into the system.

I had to ensure that any new component covered all use cases found throughout our products, and maintained consistency with the rest of the system.

              <p>
                I developed a general process for component design that collaborated closely with UX research and created lots of opportunities for feedback from the team.

                <p>
                  In some cases, I noticed that components seemed to have a lot of overlap with each other. To clear up confusion for product teams, I created flowcharts that mapped out the exact scenarios in which components were to be used, collaborating with UX research. We created these for concepts such as loading indicators and notifications.

                All of the previous work I described above came to a halt when the company transitioned from PerkinElmer to Revvity. Moving forward with a completely new design language and branding guidelines, we redefined our product design and UI in a very short time period!

                  We worked alongside product teams, stretching our capacity to include both rebranded components and newly requested ones on an urgent basis. Even in the midst of rebranding, software updates still had to be released, so we made both happen simultaneously.

                <p>
                  It was a challenge to define the new branding for digital design, as we were given colour palettes and assets that had been designed around marketing and web usage, including a bright yellow as the main brand colour. Now, we had to figure out how to apply this to product design. We decided to focus more on usability and following best practices for medical applications.
                </p>
                <div class="callout callout-yellow">
                  <h4>
                    Certain colours such as yellow, red, and green are synonymous with crucial system status indicators — warning, error, and success. Therefore, we avoided using these colours in other contexts to maintain their  significance.
                  </h4>
                </div>
                <p>
                  This was the biggest challenge, as the previous PerkinElmer brand was based on a blue primary brand colour. To move forward, we decided on a black-and-white, high contrast approach, reserving colours for specific use cases where it was needed to convey meaning.

                <p>
                  Many teams reached out to us with questions about how to apply the design system to their rebranded products. Oftentimes, they had been relying on colour usage to show hierarchy and make certain areas stand out. Since our new design system phased out many of these patterns, they needed direction to proceed, especially teams without dedicated UX designers. To alleviate this issue, I dove into product design, showcasing how to use our components and creating an ever-growing library of examples for other teams to reference.

              <p>
                While the rebranding of the design system was in its early stages, I decided to use this opportunity to improve our processes and align the system with best practices. I justified my proposal by explaining how this was the best time to invest in process improvements - we had fewer components to manage, and lots of future time-saving potential.

                  To ensure my variable system matched best practices, I attended Config 2023 to learn about the newly released features, and watched videos from other design system creators.

                </div>

                <p>
                  <b>Primitive</b> variables, also known as base or atomic-level tokens, are simply values (hex codes and numeric values) that are used globally across the system. They generally follow a naming convention that aligns with the variable’s literal definition.
                  <ul class="regular-list">
                    <li>

                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Semantic</b> variables, also known as brand or reference tokens, express function and intent in their naming. These values are tied back to the Primitives set, allowing us to reference many use cases for one colour.
                  <ul class="regular-list">
                    <li>
                      Spacing/Small, Spacing/Medium, Spacing/Large

                    <li>
                      TextDark, TextMedium, TextLight
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      ComponentStates/Valid, ComponentStates/Invalid

                <p>
                  As shown above, each ‘primitive’ variable can be referenced to multiple ‘semantic’ variables. This provides ultimate flexibility because we are able to make global changes to the system by changing primitive values, and targeted changes by changing the reference value of a semantic variable. I came up with three collections of variables to publish, and continuously added to the system as I designed new components.

                <h6>Key Takeaways</h6>
                <p>
                  I learned so much from working on this project over 2 years, and am super grateful that my work had such a big impact.
                  <ul class="regular-list">
                    <li>
                      <b>Building and maintaining a design system:</b> First of all, I learned that maintaining a design system is almost as much work as building one in the first place. 😂 I gained practical experience in both of these areas, being the "go-to" person for the design system while I was there. I'd say I encountered every situation imaginable, in terms of design systems: I started it up from the ground up, presented to senior leaders for support, helped scale things up, got development stakeholders involved, built 20+ components, rebranded many of these components after the divestiture, and exemplified how the design system would work in real applications.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Preventing errors:</b> It's pretty common for designers to experience issues with their prototypes, or even broken designs, if components are not structured and updated properly. To avoid this, I researched a bunch of advanced Figma tricks and kept up-to-date on emerging features that solved these issues. I worked alongside designers to ensure my components were built with a consistent structure that could be updated in the future, without risking everyone's designs!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Project management:</b> I learned to balance many aspects of the project including communication with stakeholders, giving frequent progress updates, synchronizing the documentation with internal assets, and managing timelines.
