                  WinPREP is a software designed to work with the Fontus hardware system, which are both produced by Revvity (previously known as PerkinElmer). Following the company divestiture, 80+ Revvity products had to be rebranded within a year to comply with legal requirements. This was a massive undertaking for most teams, especially those without embedded UXers. Myself and one other designer were asked to help this team rebrand. Thinking long-term, we also took the opportunity to re-design the application based on user pain points and usability issues.

                  This case study will showcase our transformation of WinPREP, the challenges we overcame, the UX principles we followed, and the end result.

                  To understand the project context, we met with stakeholders (product manager, developers, proxy users, subject matter experts) to discuss the current state, requirements, and team priorities. We also started learning the general workflow after speaking to our proxy users.

                    We learned that the developers were already in a code-freeze period, so the work had to be completed very urgently. They were due for a software update and senior leadership expected the product to be rebranded in time for this.

                      Some of our UX colleagues had conducted remote user interviews to identify pain points, so we looked through their findings to spot opportunities and understand real user sentiments.

                        Interesting finding: The original software uses a sunset picture as a placeholder to indicate ‘ready’ system status. Internal stakeholders assumed it was redundant and unnecessary, but many of our users found it comforting. As a result, we decided to keep some sort of imagery there to retain the secure feeling.

                      Our colleagues also had a chance to visit the labs in-person and speak with customers. From the photos and information they provided, I pieced together how the software and hardware interact. This was super valuable as we needed to consider what’s happening on the Fontus machine along each step of the process.

                    <p>
                      Here are some key insights I picked up:
                      <ul class="regular-list">
                        <li>
                          The sunset photo shows that the hardware is working and ready to operate. There is also a hidden ‘instrument log’ that can be accessed by clicking a small icon, in the top right corner of the sunset.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Once the user starts a protocol, the sunset will be replaced by instructions. Essentially, all the information and action buttons will appear in that widget. All the other sections of the page are used for navigation or visualization purposes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Warning and error messages are often displayed with 4-5 separate indicators: in the widget itself, the navigation bar, the status bar, the timer, and/or the step list.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>

              <h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="ten-twelfth-column">
              <p>
                Next, we decided to analyze the current designs through a heuristic evaluation. The purpose was to identify and call out issues that we could work on, based on common UX principles. Since we did not have time to carry out primary testing with users, this was a great option to solve the most crucial problems. We treated this as a deliverable for the team as it helped to justify the design decisions we made later on. The software could be divided into six main screens - one for each navigation tab. We annotated each one with a careful balance of positive and constructive feedback.
              </p>
              <img class="case-study-inline-pics" src="/Images/winprep-heuristic.png" alt="Samples of positive and negative feedback given for a screen.">
              <p>
                Our analysis focused on the following usability heuristics (from NN Group):
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Visibility of system status</b>
                <ul class="regular-list">
                  <li>
                    Ensure that status indicators are clear and point to the cause/location of errors.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Let users know how much time is left for an experiment.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Sense of control and freedom</b>
                <ul class="regular-list">
                  <li>
                    Make it easy for users to recognize the protocol they’re following and anticipate the next step. A step wizard can be effective for this purpose, giving users confidence and control over their process. It should also be easy to go back to a previous step or undo an action.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Consistency and standards</b>
                <ul class="regular-list">
                  <li>
                    Follow established patterns or industry conventions. It is more common to put progress/instructions on the left side of the screen, which fits the “F-shape” reading pattern.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Use our design system components and icons consistently throughout the application. These have already been screened for usability, and will help minimize cognitive load.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Aesthetic and minimalist design</b>
                <ul class="regular-list">
                  <li>
                    While errors are very easy to spot in this application, the indicators used are too repetitive, making it difficult to narrow down the exact source or location of an error. Some of these elements distract the user from the information they actually need.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Keep the UI focused on the essentials - unnecessary use of colour is a distraction and possibly even dangerous for medical applications. For example, yellow should be used sparingly in designs.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>

                  Now we had a pretty good idea of <i>how</i> the application worked, <i>where</i> problems were occurring, and <i>what</i> to do to fix them. We had already made note of the components used in this app, so we pulled in assets from our design system for maximum efficiency.
                </p>

                <div class="row-in-column fade-in">
                    <h6>First iteration</h6>
                    <p>
                      To start out, I worked on the 6 main application screens with my co-designer. We made improvements to the most critical usability issues and rebranded components to align with Revvity standards. This was also a test exercise in using our design system, since this was the first product to fully adopt its UI.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <ul class="regular-list">
                        <li>
                          Challenge: Yellow is the primary Revvity brand colour, yet it should not be used without a reason in medical applications because it signifies a warning. This is a challenge we tackled with the design system itself (as I also played a key role in designing components), but becomes even more challenging for a full product. We reduced the usage of yellow in the UI, keeping it to a minimum while ensuring we used other branding elements to make it a recognizable Revvity product.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>
                    <img class="case-study-inline-pics" src="/Images/winprep-1st-iteration.png" alt="1st round iteration">
                    <p>
                      As soon as we had something ready to show the team, we started a feedback loop between the design team and product team. We encountered a few challenges with the layout that we resolved through iterative design:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <ul class="regular-list">
                        <li>
                          When we moved the progress indicator (step wizard) to the left side, we originally thought the rest of the layout could stay the same. However, this gave the tabs an awkward appearance, especially when the active tab was directly over a separate line (i.e. when the ‘Place’ tab is active).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Some screens required a progress bar. Initially, I placed this at the top right in an extra panel. However, the buttons underneath it sometimes interfered with the main content, and information appeared cluttered/disorganized.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="row-in-column fade-in">
                  <h6>Second iteration</h6>
                  <p>
                    In the next iteration, I combined the tabs and WinPREP logo into a more common top navigation style. This allowed me to line up the navigation links with the main page content, and essentially divide the page into a left and right side. The left side became a panel that focused on system status (we moved the system status, progress bar, and step wizard here), while the right side contained the main content, instructions, and buttons.

                  <p>
                    At this point, we had completed a few design explorations and found a good direction to follow. However, we discussed capacity with the development team at this stage, and decided to focus on 3 critical objectives for their first release. We prepared wireframes that only included these most important updates, and handed this off to the developers. The changes consisted of new tabs, buttons, and an updated status widget:
                  </p>

                  <h6>Digging Deeper: System Status</h6>
                  <p>
                    While working on the updates, the team requested further help regarding system status. There are many types of warnings and errors, and some colleagues worried that the indicators were not clear enough. Also, they needed a colour to express ‘neutral’ system status, but the Revvity palette is very minimal. We worked with them to identify the best option for this and make recommendations on appropriate locations for status indicators. We picked a light blue-turquoise shade to denote neutral status, since blue is commonly associated with basic information (not warning/error/success). To ensure clear communication, I prepared a document in Figma that detailed the specs for system status indicators.

                  <h6>Final Iterations: Thinking Long-Term</h6>
                  <p>
                    Now that we’d handed off an MVP, we started thinking about long-term UX visions. We continued from the previous iterations, revisited some ideas, tried out different layouts, and much more.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    A lot of our final iterations were simply working out minute UI details, as we had resolved most of the bigger issues by this point. We ran through the whole flow to ensure everything made sense, and used a couple of newer Revvity products as inspiration for the overall look. In the end, we prepared a set of final screens that put all of our UX recommendations into action. We handed this off to the product team and encouraged them to apply these changes once they have capacity. With that, our work on this project was complete!

                WinPREP has evolved beyond just adopting the Revvity branding; it offers an improved user experience that directly tackles issues highlighted by users. The interface now features clearer system status indicators, more intuitive patterns, and a streamlined, minimalist design. I was excited to see the product functioning smoothly alongside its hardware component in a real lab - my teammate and I were very lucky to witness this!

                Although we proposed a lot of UX improvements, not all were implemented in the first development cycle. This is pretty normal due to time constraints and team capacity, but I hope the team will consider them for the next update. Here are some key things I learned from this project:
              </p>
              <p>
                <ul class="regular-list">
                  <li>
                    As a designer, it’s important to justify your choices and counter-propose ideas when needed. At the same time, understand what your stakeholders’ priorities are and design around them to maximize your impact.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    It’s better to get something approved and released by the product team, rather than nothing at all! Always work with your team to see what’s possible. In this case, we created a second, improved version to encourage future development, but still allowed the team to meet their deadlines with an ‘MVP’ style re-design.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I learned how to use product design challenges to inform the company design system. Since many of our components had not been tested on real products yet, this helped to identify what was and wasn't working. The insights gathered from this project were pulled back into the design system and we improved 3 components.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
