                <h6>Research Context</h6>
                <p>This research took place in pre-natal testing laboratories which are located in two major Ontario hospitals. I visited
                  both hospitals with 1-2 other researchers each day, with the assistance of an account manager who maintains relationships
                  with our customers. During each visit, we observed and spoke with lab technicians and managers who perform tasks ranging
                  from sample intake to data entry to analysis. Through contextual inquiry and laddering techniques, we gathered insights
                  from each user to understand their entire process, mental model, and what helps vs. hinders their work. Afterwards, we
                  synthesized the information into 3 workflows: one for each hospital lab, and an additional flow to encapsulate how lab
                  managers monitor the performance of Ontario sonographers.</p>
                
                <div class="row-in-column fade-in">
                    <h6>The Lab's Workflow & Process</h6>
                    <p>Thousands of pre-natal samples come in from LifeLabs each week (Canada’s main provider of lab tests), and a small
                      number of Ontario labs are responsible for reading and analyzing the data to test for various diseases and congenital
                      abnormalities. There is a heavy data entry component to this work, because each sample is accompanied by a requisition
                      form from the patient’s physician or health care provider. The hospitals currently use a competitor product to record
                      requisition details (i.e. patient information, date/time of sample) and export results. In conjunction with this, they
                      use a Revvity hardware product - the AutoDELFIA - to read sample data.</p>
                    <div class="callout callout-orange">
                        <h4>
                          Our goal was to understand the entire process, moving beyond software to observe user interactions across all
                          aspects of the workflow.
                        </h4>

                <div class="row-in-column fade-in">
                    <h6>Data Protection</h6>
                    <p>While conducting this research, we had to ensure all sensitive data was protected, especially because we were
                      visiting hospitals with real patient data. We did not photograph or record most of the lab areas to respect these
                      privacy protocols. Instead, the research team took handwritten notes. We also maintained an unobtrusive presence
                      to respect the technicians who were busy in the lab.</p>

                <h6>Pre-Visit</h6>
                <p>Prior to the field work, we met with the account manager and a couple of product managers to plan our research.
                  Our goal was to align our team (UX) with the product team, as they did not have dedicated UXers - we were essentially
                  running a pilot study. We needed to gather as much background information as possible, understand the project’s objectives,
                  and devise user research questions that would uncover helpful insights for the product team.</p>

                <div class="row-in-column fade-in">
                    <h6>Hospital Visits</h6>
                    <p>On the days of our hospital visits, we had the opportunity to speak with 2 lab managers and 10+ technicians.
                      Upon arriving, we conducted an initial interview with the account manager to confirm our game plan and reach a
                      mutual understanding. We also introduced ourselves to the lab workers and explained the purpose of our work,
                      aiming to establish rapport.</p>
                    <p>We had a few user research questions from our planning beforehand, but started things off as open-ended as possible.
                      First, we met with the lab manager at each hospital and asked them to run through the whole process that occurs in the
                      lab (following a standard contextual inquiry protocol). Then, we spoke with various lab technicians to gain more insights
                      on the specific details of tasks like data entry and sample intake.</p>
                    <div class="callout callout-orange">
                        <h4>
                          Lab managers tend to have a broad point-of-view as they are responsible for supervising all lab activities,
                          while technicians are laser-focused on one aspect of the workflow. We used this to our advantage as it was important
                          for us to understand both the high-level process and minute details to identify challenges and opportunities.
                        </h4>
                    </div>
                    <p>A lot of the research was conducted in a master-apprentice interview style, as we wanted to learn from these expert users.
                      We asked many questions and confirmed uncertainties to ensure we understood the purpose of each action and knew the different
                      situations that could occur. Some questions and laddering techniques we used include:
                        “What would you do if ____ happened instead?”
                        “Why did you choose this option?”
                        “Does this happen frequently or is it an exception?”</p>
                </div>

                <div class="row-in-column fade-in">
                    <h6>Post-Visit</h6>
                    <p>After departing the lab each day, we had a debriefing session with the research team and account manager. We went over our notes
                      in more detail to ensure everyone had the same understanding. Documentation was also crucial for this project to ensure other team
                      members can access the raw data if needed, and for building up the team’s research repository. As a result, we referred back to our
                      pre-visit documents and ensured all questions were answered in here.</p>
                    <p>Now we were at the final step: creating final deliverables that could be shared with the broader team. I collaborated closely with
                      the other two researchers to synthesize our findings, mapping out everything including user steps, decisions, questions, pain points,
                      and opportunities. We constructed a detailed workflow map for each hospital to illustrate the required tasks for their process.</p>

              <h6>Personal Learning</h6>
              <p>
                This was an invaluable learning experience for me, and the most interesting field work I’ve had the opportunity to work on.
                I honed my skills working with users, learning how to use laddering techniques practically and ask effective follow-up questions.
                I also realized how important it is to be precise and clarify topics you don’t understand - I found that vague or ambiguous
                information was sometimes the result of an issue that we hadn’t yet uncovered.
              </p>
              <div class="callout callout-orange">
                  <h4>
                    Users may come up with workarounds to complete their tasks but don’t explicitly describe it that way, so I asked follow-up
                    questions to understand why they have to do this and what the application design is missing. This helped me uncover many new
                    opportunities and research recommendations.
                  </h4>
              </div>
              <p>Additionally, when you keep precise notes and feel confident about your understanding during field work, it will be much easier
                to synthesize findings later - any confusion you had will only be amplified later, when it’s not as fresh in your mind.</p>

              <div class="row-in-column fade-in">
                  <h6>Research & Product Outcomes</h6>
                  <p>
                    We synthesized a lot of research and insights to come up with 20+ actionable recommendations, related to various design aspects
                    and logistical processes that could be improved. In terms of our handover process, we provided the product manager with a summary
                    of all our findings, which included a concise list of pros and cons from the perspective of each hospital and user type
                    (lab manager/technician). We also sent our field notes for future reference and walked through all 3 workflow maps. Our research
                    was instrumental in guiding future product discussions, providing actionable changes that will increase the adoption of Revvity’s
                    pre-natal screening software in hospitals globally, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve health outcomes for millions of patients.
